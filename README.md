This project analyzes UK corporate registration and financial data to uncover trends related to corporate structure, industry resilience, and economic wellbeing. We will explore the distribution of company types (e.g., private limited vs. public companies) to identify dominant business structures and their temporal development. Additionally, we will investigate leadership trends by examining the roles of corporate officers and their impact on company performance.

The project also analyzes active and dissolved companies within various SIC divisions to assess industry resilience and market stability, taking into account external economic factors that affect company longevity. Finally, it explores foreign ownership to pinpoint industries attracting international investors, providing insights into key economic and strategic drivers.

The findings aim to support policymakers, investors, and business leaders in making informed decisions to foster sustainable growth and innovation within the UK economy.
